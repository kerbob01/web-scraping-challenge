# web-scraping-challenge
Mission to Mars is a web scraping app that will access the Mars.gov website and scrape the latest news. Then access the JPL.gov web site and get the latest featured images. Next it will scrape the latest Mars weather from twitter. After accessing twitter, it accesses spacefacts.com and gathers facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc. Then is accesses USGS Astrogeology site to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres. Lastly it put the data in to a MongoDB so it can be accessed by flask to create a custom HTML page with all the images.
